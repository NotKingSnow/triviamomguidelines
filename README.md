Hi, welcome to the Trivia Moms club! This document is here to serve as a guide for the newcomers.
 
How do you make questions? Pretty easily!
 
Here look at this example:
 
q "**What is the first book in A Song of Ice and Fire?**"
a "A Game of Thrones"
 
For questions with multiple potential answers:
q "**S01E01: Who is the first Targaryen to appear on screen in House of the Dragon?**"
a "King Jaehaerys I Targaryen", "Jaehaerys I Targaryen", "Jaehaerys Targaryen", "Jaehaerys I", "Jaehaerys 1", "J1", "Jaehaerys"
 
Do you want to include a image in your question?
 
q "**Name the character in the picture.**"
a "Lyanna Stark", "Lyanna"

Hi, welcome to the Trivia Moms club! This document is here to serve as a guide for the newcomers.
 
How do you make questions? Pretty easily!
 
Here look at this example:
 
q "**Who is the goat fighter?**"
a "Barristan Selmy"
 
For questions with multiple potential answers
q "**Who is the goat fighter?**"
a "Barristan Selmy", "Barristan"
 
Do you want to include a image in your question?
 
q "**Name the character in the picture.**"
a "Lyanna Stark", "Lyanna"

MAKE SURE YOUR IMGUR LINK MATCHES OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT SHOW

Scoring options for trivia:
;;trivia edit name scoring FIRST
(First makes it so only one person can get the answer correct. Also make sure FIRST is in all caps)
 
;;trivia edit name scoring REDUCTIVE
(Reductive makes it so 5 people are allowed to get the answer correct. Make sure reductive is also in caps)
